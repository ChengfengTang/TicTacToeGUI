ICS 32 final project Tic Tac Toe by Cheng Tang and Mu Rong

TicTacToeGUI is the frontend graphical userinterface file
TicTacToe is the backend Tic Tac Toe game.

Topics we learnt and included
Modules, Classes, tkinterGUI, Recursion

please put both files in the same folder and execute TicTacToeGUI

There are two levels 

"Easy": AI plays randomly 

"Hard": AI uses minimax algorithm to calculate the best move out of all outcomes. (The player should not be able to win)


Hit either one of the buttons ("Easy"/"Hard") to start the game
	 a text box will prompt out indicating if the player is starting first
		if the player is not starting first, there should be a "O" on the board already

After a game is over (Win/Lose/Tie)
	a text box will prompt out indicating the result of the game
	player has to hit either one of the game-mode buttons again to start a new round

The score is being tracked at the bottom


Regarding Bonus:
At first, we were just thinking about creating a Tic Tac Toe game with only the (PVE) easy game mode and the PVP (offline) game mode.
We considered making the PVP part online, however, because we were unfamilar with hosting servers while receiving and sending data, 
we decided to incorporate the (PVE) hard game mode, it was, ngl, a lot of fun learning about the algorithm.
